(* this one requires some thinking and understanding before. *)

(* the parser should obviously generate an object, or a hashmap, or
   something; maybe a record. *)

(* the encoder should take a string - an email address - and generate
   such a record (? is this necessary ?) then encode it.

   maybe it's like this; the encoder takes the record and then encodes it?
   or wth *)

(* okay, it's probably like this.
   think of the records as what's kept in memory; they're encoded and encrypted
   when saved to drive.
   what we want to do is write a thing such that when that thing is decrypted and
   parsed, we become admin.
